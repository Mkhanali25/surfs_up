# Surfs_Up
## Overview
In this challenge we were tasked with using sqlalchemy to perform various tasks on our data. We had to determine if opening a surf and ice cream shop is sustainable year round. For this challenge we had to get the temperature for the months of June and December to determine if the shop would be sustainable. 

## Results
* The first difference between the month of June and December is the average temp.
  * the month of June has an average temp of 74.94
  * the month of December has an average temp of 71.041529
* The second difference between the two months is the percipitation 
  * the month of June has an average 0.14
  * the month of December has an average percipitation of 0.21
* The third difference between the two months is the lowest temp 
  * the month of June has an minimum temp of 64
  * the month of December has an minimum temp of 56

## Summary
Based off the results from our analysis we can conclude that the temperatures from June and December don't vary a lot. If W. Avy was to go ahead and sponser this project the temp and percipitation wouldn't effect his business a lot. Since the two months practically had similar data sets. The only way that this business would fail is because it wasn't managed properly.
